# Trello Clone App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run

you can run the app using the following script:

### `npm start`

So here I've defined the core functionality of adding new lists and new cards, and editing the card text.

Also I kept the state stored in localStorage for persistency

while you asked to commit to the 4 hours time interval to be working on this task, I honestly took 3

more hours to get it to the current state
