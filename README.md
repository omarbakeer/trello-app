# Trello Clone App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run

you can run the app using the following script:

`npm install`
then
 `npm start`

So here I've defined the core functionality of 
- adding new lists 
- add new cards
- edit card text
- keep state stored in localStorage for persistency

*while you asked to commit to the 4 hours time interval to be working on this task, I honestly took 3 more hours to get it to the current state.*

so the implementation is based on the request of not using any extra module, I used both `useReducer` and `context API` to mimic the redux state management system.

if I had more time I would have completed:
- moving card between lists
- enhanced the user experience
- add more test cases to add confidence
